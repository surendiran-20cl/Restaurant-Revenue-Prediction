# **Restaurant Revenue Prediction**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting **restaurant revenue** using **Linear Regression**. The dataset consists of restaurant attributes, with **order volume** (`Order_Placed`) as the primary independent variable. The model is trained using **supervised learning techniques**, and its accuracy is evaluated using the **R² Score**.  

---

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains the following attributes:  

| **Feature**       | **Description**  | **Type**  |  
|------------------|-----------------|----------|  
| `ID`            | Unique identifier for each restaurant | Categorical |  
| `Name`          | Name of the restaurant | Categorical |  
| `Franchise`     | Whether the restaurant is a franchise (Yes/No) | Binary |  
| `Category`      | Type of restaurant service or cuisine | Categorical |  
| `City`         | Location of the restaurant | Categorical |  
| `No_of_item`    | Number of different menu items | Numerical |  
| `Order_Placed`  | Number of orders placed by customers (in lacs) | Numerical |  
| `Revenue`       | Total income generated by the restaurant (Target Variable) | Numerical |  

For model training, only **Order_Placed** was selected as the predictor, while other features were dropped.

## **Implementation Steps**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Removed unnecessary columns (`Id`, `Name`, `Franchise`, `Category`, `City`, `No_of_item`).  
- Checked and handled missing values.  
- Split data into **training (80%) and testing (20%)** sets.  

### **2. Model Selection & Training**  
- **Linear Regression** was chosen as the predictive model.  
- The model was trained on **Order_Placed** as the independent variable (`X`) to predict **Revenue** (`y`).  
- A scatter plot was used to visualize revenue trends against order volume.  

### **3. Model Evaluation**  
- **R² Score:** The model achieved an accuracy of **91.1% (0.91 R² Score)**, indicating a strong correlation between **order volume and revenue**.

## **Model Performance**  
| Metric      | Value  |  
|------------|--------|  
| **R² Score** | 0.91   |  

- The **R² Score of 0.91** suggests that **Order_Placed** explains **91% of the variance** in restaurant revenue.  
- The model effectively captures revenue trends, though adding more features may further improve accuracy.
